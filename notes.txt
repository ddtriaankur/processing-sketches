Data
			Manipulating Strings
			Splitting and Joining Strings
	Reading and Writing Text Files
			- loadStrings() 	::is used to read the content of the file into an String array.
			- the individual lines of text in the file each become an individual element in the array.

Render Techniques
	P2D and P3D uses OpenGl
	The visual quality if the OpenGL renderers can be adjusted with the smooth() & hint() functions
	smooth(8); 	//2 is default :: 4 imporves the anti-aliasing quality

	PGraphics :: built in processing's methods will be defined through the dot operator. 
						:: Variable still belong to the main program

	OpenGL surfaces 

	clear() :: removes the background	and fills them with transparency			
	tint()  ?? what are the blend options
	blendMode(DimensionalRKEST);
	blendMode(MULTIPLY);
	blendMode(BLEND); //default blend mode

...
Arrays
	set of data elements stored under the same name
	created to hold any type of data
	last position is length -1 

	int[] x = {50, 61, 83, 69, 71, 50, 29, 31, 17, 39}   		//declare, create and assign

	int[] data
	data = new int[5]

	data.length 		//give the length of the array

	abs(sin(r))

	Record data
		// the most recent 100 values from mouseY are stored & displayed on screen 
		// read the array from the last
	Ring buffer 
		//The following example produces the same result as the previous one but uses a more efficient technique. Instead of shifting the array elements in each frame, the program writes the new data to the next available array position. The elements in the array remain in the same position once they are written, but they are read in a different order each frame. Reading begins at the location of the oldest data element and continues to the end of the array. At the end of the array, the % operator (p. 57) is used to wrap back to the beginning. This technique, commonly known as a ring buffer, is especially useful with larger arrays, to avoid unnecessary copying of data that can slow down a program.

............................
	Array funcitons
		arrayCopy(north, south); // Copy from north array to>> south array
		When an array is used as a param to a function, the address (location in memory) of the array is transferred into the function instead of the actual data. //aka Call by referrence.

	Array of objects
	
	Enhanced for loop
		for (<data type> s : <array-name>){
			s.move();
			s.display();
		}
	- each object in the array is in turn assigned to the variable s
	- statement inside the loop run for each element of the array until the end

	Two-dimensional Arrays
		int [] [] x = {{50,0}, {61,20}, {83,51}, {71,9}};

Interactivity

	mousePressed boolean variable
	mouseButton == LEFT
	mouseButton == RIGHT
	mouseButton == CENTER

	keyPressed boolean variable	
	"key" store the single variable 
		key == 'A' for char 
	ASCII table defines the uppercase A as the number 65, and the digit 1 is defined as 49.

	keyCode == UP :: variable stores ALT. CONTROL, SHIFT, UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT keys as constant
	key == CODED :: to check if key is CODED
	Event
