Render Techniques
	P2D and P3D uses OpenGl
	The visual quality if the OpenGL renderers can be adjusted with the smooth() & hint() functions
	smooth(8); 	//2 is default :: 4 imporves the anti-aliasing quality

	PGraphics :: built in processing's methods will be defined through the dot operator. 
						:: Variable still belong to the main program

	OpenGL surfaces 

	clear() :: removes the background	and fills them with transparency			
	tint()  ?? what are the blend options
	blendMode(DimensionalRKEST);
	blendMode(MULTIPLY);
	blendMode(BLEND); //default blend mode

Arrays
	set of data elements stored under the same name
	created to hold any type of data
	last position is length -1 

	int[] x = {50, 61, 83, 69, 71, 50, 29, 31, 17, 39}   		//declare, create and assign

	int[] data
	data = new int[5]

	data.length 		//give the length of the array

	abs(sin(r))

	Record data
	Ring buffer 

	Array funcitons
		arrayCopy(north, south); // Copy from north array to>> south array
		When an array is used as a param to a function, the address (location in memory) of the array is transferred into the function instead of the actual data. //aka Call by referrence.

	Array of objects
	
	Enhanced for loop
		for (<data type> s : <array-name>){
			s.move();
			s.display();
		}
	- each object in the array is in turn assigned to the variable s
	- statement inside the loop run for each element of the array until the end

	Two-dimensional Arrays
		int [] [] x = {{50,0}, {61,20}, {83,51}, {71,9}};

Interactivity

	mousePressed boolean variable
	mouseButton == LEFT
	mouseButton == RIGHT
	mouseButton == CENTER

	keyPressed boolean variable	
	"key" store the single variable 
		key == 'A' for char 
	ASCII table defines the uppercase A as the number 65, and the digit 1 is defined as 49.

	keyCode == UP :: variable stores ALT. CONTROL, SHIFT, UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT keys as constant
	key == CODED :: to check if key is CODED
	Event
