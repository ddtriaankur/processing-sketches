1 The Seven Stages of Visualizing Data	:: covers the process fro developing a useful viz, from acquiring data to interacting with it.
		- Great viz never starts from the standpoint of the data set; it starts with ques.
		- Why was the data collected, 
		- what's interesting about it, and 
		- what stroies can it tell?

		- The more specific you can make your question, the more specific and clear the visual result will be.
		- In short, a proper viz is a king of narrative, providing a clear answer to a ques without extraneous details.
		- Understanding Data
				- Acquire	- Parse - Filter - Mine - Represent - Refine - Interact 
			- These steps can't be followed slavishly. Sometimes it will be 4 out of 7, & other all of them.

	Principles
		Each Project Has Unique Requirement
				- Every problem is unique, so capitalize on that uniqueness to solve the problem.
		Avoid the All-You-Can-Eat Buffet
				- less details will actually convey more information 
				- Just because it can be measured doesn't mean it should.
				- Perhaps making things simple is worth bragging about, but making complex messes is not.
				- Find the smallest amount of data that can still convey something meaningful about the contents of the data set.
		Know Your Audience 
				- In what way will your audience use the piece?
		
		We will tackle the problems of having too much data & having data that can change.
