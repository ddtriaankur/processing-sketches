Preface
		Computational Information Design
		Chapter 1-4 can be understood by someone without any programming background.

1 The Seven Stages of Visualizing Data	:: covers the process from developing a useful viz, from acquiring data to interacting with it.
		- Great viz never starts from the standpoint of the data set; it starts with ques.
		- Why was the data collected, 
		- what's interesting about it, and 
		- what stroies can it tell?

		- The more specific you can make your question, the more specific and clear the visual result will be.
		- In short, a proper viz is a king of narrative, providing a clear answer to a ques without extraneous details.
		- Understanding Data
				- Acquire	- Parse - Filter - Mine - Represent - Refine - Interact 
			- These steps can't be followed slavishly. Sometimes it will be 4 out of 7, & other all of them.

	Principles
		Each Project Has Unique Requirement
				- Every problem is unique, so capitalize on that uniqueness to solve the problem.
		Avoid the All-You-Can-Eat Buffet
				- less details will actually convey more information 
				- Just because it can be measured doesn't mean it should.
				- Perhaps making things simple is worth bragging about, but making complex messes is not.
				- Find the smallest amount of data that can still convey something meaningful about the contents of the data set.
		Know Your Audience 
				- In what way will your audience use the piece?
		
		We will tackle the problems of having too much data & having data that can change.

Chapter 2 Getting Started with Processing   19 - 30
		- Exporting and Distributing Your Work
			- File --> Export
			- saveFrame("output-####.png");  //saving Images
		- Examples and Refrence
			- More About the size() Method

		- Functions
		- Sketching and Scripting 
		- Ready?

			- We'll cover how to integrate Java and Processing toward the end of the book.
			- The language syntax, identical to Java but with a few modifications. The changes are laid out in detail toward the end of the book.
							Tip
								- Use External Editor in the Pref
			- size(400,400, JAVA2D);  //default
			- size(400, 400, P2D);
			- size(400, 400, P3D);
			- size(400, 400, OPENGL); 	
				:: uses SUn's Java OpenGL lib for faster rednering
				:: import library --> OpenGL 
			- size(400, 400, PDF, "filename-####.pdf");
				:: import the PDF lib
				:: cousin of the Java2D renderer
						- P2D and P3D are great for pixel-based work, while JAVA2D and PDF settings will give you the highest quality. 
		- Loading and Displaying Data
			- loadImage() and loadStrings() functions each xpect to find a file inside a folder named data, which is a subdir of the sketch folder
			- loadStrings() reads a text file into an array of String objects, and
			- loadImage() reads an image into a PImage object, the container for image data in Processing. Code Example
				- String[] lines = loadStrings("something.txt");
				- PImage[] img = loadImage("picture.jpg");
			- Sketch --> Show sketch folder  ::view the contents of the sketch folder
				>> String[] lines = loadStrings("http://benfry.com/writing/map/locations.tsv") ;	//also use full path names to local files. or URL
				>> String[] lines = loadStrings ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddtriaankur/processing-sketches/master/notes.txt");

				>> PImage image = loadImage("http://benfry,com/writing/map.png");

		Functions	
			- Acquire
					loadStrings(), loadBytes() 
			- Parse
					split()
			- Filter
					for(), if (item[i].startsWith())
			- Mine
					min(), max(), abs()
			- Represent
					map(), beginShape(), endShape()
			- Refine
					fill(), strokeWeight(), smooth()
			- Interact
					mouseMoved(), mouseDragged(), keyPressed()

		Libraries Add New Features
			- import processing.xml.*;
				- XMLElement xml = new XMLElement(this, "sites.xml") ;
			- The "this" object is used because it lets the library make use of the core API functions to draw to the screen or load files.
		Don't Start by Trying to Build a Cathedral
			- Of course, once things are working, avoid the urge to rewrite for its own sake.
			- A rewrite should be used when addressing a completely different problem.
